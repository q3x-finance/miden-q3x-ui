# Modules Overview

Q3x's modular architecture is one of its core strengths, allowing teams to customize their account management experience by adding, removing, or combining different modules. Each module adds specific functionality to your account, and modules can be combined to create powerful workflows.

## What are Modules?

Modules in Q3x are self-contained units of functionality that can be:

- Added or removed at any time
- Customized with specific parameters
- Combined with other modules
- Managed through both UI and AI assistant

## Module Combinations

Modules can be combined to create sophisticated workflows. For example:

- Auto Payment + Whitelist: Ensure automated payments only go to approved addresses
- Spending Limits + Extra Signer: Add additional security for high-value transactions
- Auto Payment + Bridge: Automate cross-chain payments

## Managing Modules

Modules can be managed through:

1. The Q3x dashboard interface
2. Natural language commands via AI assistant (COMING SOON)

## Available Modules

Currently available modules:

### [Auto Payment Module](./auto-payment.md)

Automate recurring payments with customizable parameters:

- Payment schedules (One time, Daily, Weekly, Yearly)
- Token selection
- Amount configuration
