# Swap Token

The swap feature allows you to exchange one token for another within Q3x. This guide will walk you through the process of swapping tokens powered by [Avnu](https://doc.avnu.fi/).

## Selecting Tokens and Amount

1. **Token Selection**

   - Click on the token dropdown to view available tokens
   - Select the token you wish to swap from and to
   - The current balance of the selected token will be displayed

2. **Amount Input**
   - Enter the amount you wish to swap from
   - The "To" amount will be automatically calculated based on Avnu service
   - You can use the percentage button to swap a proportion of your balance
   - The USD equivalent for both amounts will be displayed

## Transaction Confirmation

Before swapping:

- Review the transaction details including:

  - From token amount
  - To token amount
  - Fee charged

- Click "Swap" to proceed with the transaction
- Complete any required authentication (2FA/3FA)
- Or add it to your [batch transaction](/batch_transaction) and execute in once

## Important Notes

- Always check the exchange rate before confirming
- Be aware of price impact for large swaps
- Ensure you have sufficient balance to cover both the swap amount and network fees
- Transactions cannot be reversed once confirmed on the blockchain
- Consider setting appropriate slippage tolerance based on market conditions
