# Paymaster

Q3x integrates AVNU's paymaster system to provide the ability of paying transaction gas fee in ERC20 tokens across all supported wallet types, including Braavos, Argent, MetaMask, and multisig accounts. This integration significantly enhances user experience by enabling flexible gas fee payment options.

## Supported Wallets/Accounts

Q3x's paymaster system supports the following accounts:

- Braavos
- Argent
- [MetaMask](/metamask/overview)
- [Multisig accounts](/metamask/multisig)

## Gas Payment Options

For transactions in Q3x, users gain access to multiple gas payment options:

1. **Native Token Payment**

   - Pay gas fees using the network's native token

2. **Token Payment**

   - Pay gas fees using any supported ERC20 token from AVNU

## Key Benefit

1. **Enhanced User Experience**

   - No need to maintain native tokens for gas
   - Flexible payment options
   - Simplified transaction process
