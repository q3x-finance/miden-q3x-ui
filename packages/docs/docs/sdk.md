# Connector SDK (COMING SOON)

Q3x's connector system represents an innovative approach to cross-protocol interaction on Starknet, enabling seamless integration between Q3x's batch transaction capabilities and other decentralized applications. This powerful integration tool appears as a wallet connection option alongside traditional choices like Argent and Braavos when users interact with compatible protocols.

## How It Works

### Integration Flow

1. **Connection Phase**

   - Users see Q3x as a wallet option
   - Select Q3x as their connection method
   - Code pairing between Q3x page and Dapp

2. **Transaction Capture**

   - SDK intercepts transaction intentions
   - Automatically adds to Q3x's batch system
   - No immediate execution required

3. **Batch Management**
   - Transactions appear in Q3x interface
   - Users can review and modify
   - Execute multiple transactions at once
